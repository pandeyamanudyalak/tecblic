                    <p>Today, automation is taking charge of the industries globally. it may, at first, seem like jobs of millions are in danger but fortunately it is the other way round.</p>
                    <p>Automation is directly touching lives of billions making them more efficient and productive at work by increasing focus on more vital and result-driven actions fuelling growth of the organization. automation is reducing the no. Of petty and repetitive tasks at hands with individuals thus increasing the overall efficiency and reducing the total time consumption in performing one task.</p>
                    <p>Put simply, rpa is a process of simplifying and automating tasks that require human interference. rpa with the use of a software with artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities that is stable to handle high volume repetitive tasks. Sorting and short-listing the relevant profile for hr, maintaining records of transactions and even making calculations are some of the many applications of the RPA system.</p>

            <p>Many times, rpa is misunderstood as artificial intelligence (AI). Just to clarify here, these are two different areas of technologies. while ai predicts the future trends based on past data, RPA fetches and processes the data.</p>
