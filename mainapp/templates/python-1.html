                    <p>Python is feature loaded with advantages of code portability, making code migration to other os easier as you transfer and run your codes. that means, coding can be done in one os and easily be transferred to the other os without any issue in the code.</p>
                    <p>Being one of the oldest developmental languages, python comes with an extensive library that makes it convenient for coders and developers and can be used for free. it has predefined classes that can be inherited and used for easy and quick development. Python is an open source language that gives it an added advantage.</p>

                    <p>Artificial intelligence is the human-like simulation of intelligence. It is trained to take certain defined actions and make predictions based on previously categorized data.</p>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence or ai comprises of machine learning (ml) and deep learning (dl) sciences. ML happens when machines or bots starts to gather and garner insights from the data provided by the user in form of statistical algorithms and improve the user-experience without being explicitly programmed.</p>
